description: "What to upload to Milo for the most accurate underwriting analysis."
---

The more data Milo has, the more accurate your analysis. Here's what to upload — and what Milo does with each document.

## Required Documents

These are the minimum for a solid analysis.

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="T12 (Trailing 12-Month Statement)" icon="file-invoice-dollar">
  The actual income and expense report for the last 12 months of operations. This is the single most important document — it's real numbers, not projections.

  **What Milo extracts:**
  - Line-item income (rent collected, other income)
  - Every expense category (taxes, insurance, utilities, R&M, management, G&A)
  - Net operating income
  - Month-by-month trends
</Card>

<Card title="Rent Roll" icon="table-list">
  A snapshot of every unit — who's there, what they're paying, and when their lease ends. This is your ground truth for income and occupancy.

  **What Milo extracts:**
  - Unit numbers, types, and square footage
  - In-place rent vs. market rent
  - Lease dates and expiration schedule
  - Vacancy status
  - Concessions or special pricing
</Card>

</CardGroup>

<Tip>
**T12 tip:** Upload a full 12-month statement, not a partial year. Milo can work with less, but a full year gives the most accurate annualized picture.

**Rent roll tip:** Use the most recent rent roll available — ideally within the last 30–60 days. Stale rent rolls may show tenants who've already moved or rents that have changed.
</Tip>

## Highly Recommended

These documents significantly improve the depth of your analysis.

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="Offering Memorandum (OM)" icon="book-open">
  The marketing package from the seller's broker. OMs can be 20–80+ pages and Milo handles the full document.

  **What Milo extracts:**
  - Property overview (address, year built, unit count, SF)
  - Asking price and seller's cap rate
  - Unit mix and floor plans
  - Market and submarket data
  - Renovation history and property condition
  - Photos and occupancy history
</Card>

<Card title="Unit Mix Summary" icon="grid-2">
  A breakdown of unit types, counts, sizes, and rents. If this isn't already in your OM or rent roll, upload it separately.

  **What Milo extracts:**
  - Unit type distribution (studio, 1BR, 2BR, 3BR)
  - Count, average SF, and average rent per type
</Card>

## Optional — Enhances Accuracy

These aren't required, but they help Milo cross-validate data and give you a more complete picture.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Pro Forma or Seller Projections" icon="chart-line">
  The seller's forward-looking financial projections. Milo builds its own model from the T12 and your assumptions — but if you upload the seller's pro forma, Milo can compare the two side by side so you can see exactly where the seller is being aggressive.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Historical Financials (Prior Year T12s)" icon="clock-rotate-left">
  Previous years' income and expense statements. Uploading 2–3 years of T12s lets Milo identify trends — are expenses climbing faster than income? Is occupancy improving or declining? Historical data adds context that a single-year snapshot can't provide.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Capital Improvement Records" icon="hammer">
  Documentation of past renovations, capital projects, and deferred maintenance. This helps Milo validate CapEx assumptions and assess whether the property has been well-maintained or is due for significant investment.
</Accordion>

## Tips for Best Results

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload PDFs when possible">
    PDFs with selectable text produce the best results. Scanned images of documents work but may reduce extraction accuracy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use recent documents">
    Rent rolls and T12s should be within the last 60 days. Older documents may not reflect current operations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload multiple documents">
    The more documents you provide, the more Milo can cross-validate. For example, Milo checks whether unit counts in the rent roll match the OM and unit mix — discrepancies get flagged.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Double-check time periods">
    If numbers look off, verify that you uploaded the correct time period. A T12 ending in June will look different from one ending in December due to seasonal patterns.
