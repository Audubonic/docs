---

Milo takes you from raw documents to a complete underwriting analysis. Here's what happens at each step.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Your Documents">
    Start by uploading the documents for the property you're analyzing. Milo accepts **PDF and Excel** files — you can upload one document or multiple at once.

    The key documents are:
    - **T12** (Trailing 12-Month Income & Expense Statement)
    - **Rent Roll**
    - **Offering Memorandum** (if available)

    The more you upload, the more complete your analysis. See [Suggested Documents](/using-milo/suggested-documents) for details on what to upload and why.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Milo Extracts the Data">
    Once uploaded, Milo reads your documents using AI and extracts all relevant financial data automatically.

    - Milo identifies each document type (OM, T12, Rent Roll, etc.)
    - Tables, line items, and property details are all pulled automatically
    - Data is cross-referenced across documents to validate accuracy

    For example, Milo checks whether the unit count in the rent roll matches the OM. If there's a discrepancy, it gets flagged so you can investigate.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Extracted Data">
    Milo presents the extracted data for your review before running the analysis.

    - See exactly what was pulled from each document
    - Flag anything that looks off or needs correction
    - Confidence indicators show where Milo is most and least certain about the extracted values

    This step ensures the analysis is built on accurate data. Catching an error here saves you from chasing a wrong number through the entire model.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Your Assumptions">
    Milo pre-fills assumptions with sensible defaults based on the property and market. You can adjust any of them to match your investment thesis:

    | Assumption | What It Controls |
    |-----------|-----------------|
    | Hold period | How many years you plan to own |
    | Rent growth rate | Annual rent increase projection |
    | Expense growth rate | Annual expense increase projection |
    | Exit cap rate | Assumed cap rate at sale |
    | Vacancy assumption | Stabilized vacancy percentage |
    | CapEx budget | Renovation and improvement spend |
    | Financing terms | LTV, interest rate, amortization, IO period |

    These assumptions drive the entire financial model. See [Assumptions](/glossary/assumptions) in the glossary for details on each one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Analysis">
    Click **Analyze** and Milo generates the full underwriting. The output includes:

    **Property Overview**
    - Key facts, location, unit count, year built

    **Income Breakdown**
    - GPR, vacancy, loss to lease, concessions, other income, and EGI

    **Expense Breakdown**
    - Every expense category with totals and per-unit figures

    **Net Operating Income**
    - Current NOI and projected NOI by year

    **Debt Service & Cash Flow**
    - Year-by-year projections for the full hold period
    - Annual debt service, before-tax cash flow, and net cash flow

    **Return Metrics**
    - IRR (levered and unlevered), cash-on-cash return, equity multiple, cap rate, and DSCR

    **Exit Analysis**
    - Reversion value, sale proceeds, and profit at exit

    Every number is traceable back to the source document — you can always see where a figure came from.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust and Re-Run">
    Change any assumption and re-run instantly. This is where Milo saves you the most time — instead of rebuilding a spreadsheet, you get updated results in seconds.

    **Stress-test your deal:**
    - What if vacancy is 10% instead of 5%?
    - What if interest rates go up 50 basis points?
    - What if rent growth is 2% instead of 3%?
    - What if the exit cap rate widens by 25 bps?

    Compare scenarios side by side to understand how sensitive your returns are to different market conditions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export & Share">
    When you're satisfied with the analysis, export it as a **PDF report** you can share with partners, investors, or lenders.

    The report includes all the detail from the analysis — property overview, income and expense breakdown, cash flow projections, return metrics, and exit analysis — formatted for professional presentation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The fastest path to a complete analysis: upload your T12, rent roll, and OM together, review the extracted data, and hit Analyze. You can always fine-tune assumptions afterward.
