## Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)

The ratio of NOI to property value. Cap rate tells you the unleveraged yield a property produces — what you'd earn if you paid all cash. There are two cap rates that matter in every deal:

- **Entry (going-in) cap rate** — NOI divided by your purchase price
- **Exit cap rate** — projected NOI at sale divided by the expected sale price

**Formula**

```
Cap Rate = NOI / Property Value x 100
```

**How Milo uses it:** Milo calculates the entry cap rate from your T12 NOI and purchase price. The exit cap rate is an assumption you set — it drives the projected sale price at the end of your hold period.

**Example:**

```
Entry Cap Rate = $181,978 / $4,000,000 = 4.55%
```

If you assume a 5.0% exit cap and Year 5 NOI of $210,000:

```
Exit Value = $210,000 / 5.0% = $4,200,000
```

<Note>
A lower cap rate means a higher price relative to income. Cap rates vary significantly by market, property class, and risk profile.

## Cash-on-Cash Return (CoC)

The annual cash flow you receive as a percentage of the cash you invested. This is the "what am I actually getting paid on my money this year?" metric. Unlike cap rate, CoC accounts for leverage.

**Formula**

```
Cash-on-Cash Return = Annual Before-Tax Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested x 100
```

**How Milo uses it:** Milo calculates CoC for each year of the hold period so you can see how returns ramp as rents grow and debt gets paid down.

**Example:** You invest $1,200,000 in equity and receive $72,000 in Year 1 cash flow:

```
CoC = $72,000 / $1,200,000 = 6.0%
```

## Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

The annualized return that accounts for the *timing* of every cash flow — your initial investment, annual distributions, and proceeds at sale. IRR is the industry-standard metric for comparing investments with different hold periods and cash flow profiles.

- **Levered IRR** — includes the effects of debt (the return on your equity)
- **Unlevered IRR** — ignores debt (the return on the total investment, as if all-cash)

**How Milo uses it:** Milo projects year-by-year cash flows and calculates both levered and unlevered IRR. Adjusting any assumption (rent growth, exit cap, hold period) instantly updates the IRR so you can stress-test scenarios.

**Example:** You invest $1,200,000, receive $72K–$96K/year for 5 years, and net $1,500,000 at sale after paying off the loan:

```
Levered IRR ≈ 18.2%
Unlevered IRR ≈ 11.4%
```

The spread between levered and unlevered IRR shows the impact of leverage on returns.

## Average Annual Return (AAR)

A simpler measure of annualized return — total profit divided by equity invested, spread evenly across the hold period. Unlike IRR, AAR doesn't account for the timing of cash flows, but it's useful for quick back-of-envelope comparisons.

**Formula**

```
AAR = (Total Cash Distributions + Sale Proceeds - Total Equity Invested) / (Total Equity Invested x Hold Period) x 100
```

**How Milo uses it:** Milo displays AAR alongside IRR so you can see both the time-weighted and simple annualized return. If AAR and IRR diverge significantly, it means the cash flow timing matters a lot in that deal.

**Example:** $1,200,000 invested, $420,000 total distributions over 5 years, $1,500,000 net sale proceeds:

```
AAR = ($420,000 + $1,500,000 - $1,200,000) / ($1,200,000 x 5) = 12.0%
```

## Equity Multiple (EM)

The total return on your invested equity, expressed as a multiple. An equity multiple of 2.0x means you doubled your money. Simple, intuitive, and the first thing most investors ask about.

**Formula**

```
Equity Multiple = Total Distributions + Sale Proceeds / Total Equity Invested
```

**How Milo uses it:** Milo calculates the equity multiple across the full hold period. It's displayed prominently in the returns summary.

**Example:**

```
Equity Multiple = ($420,000 + $1,500,000) / $1,200,000 = 1.60x
```

You got back $1.60 for every $1.00 invested.

## Return on Cost

Similar to cap rate, but uses your *total project cost* (purchase price + renovation + closing costs) instead of just the purchase price. This is the metric that tells you whether a value-add deal pencils — if return on cost exceeds the market cap rate, you're creating value.

**Formula**

```
Return on Cost = Stabilized NOI / Total Project Cost x 100
```

**How Milo uses it:** Milo calculates return on cost using your projected stabilized NOI and total cost basis (purchase + CapEx + closing costs). Comparing return on cost to market cap rates shows your profit margin on the value creation.

**Example:** You buy for $4M, spend $320K on renovations and $120K in closing costs, and stabilize NOI at $225,000:

```
Return on Cost = $225,000 / $4,440,000 = 5.07%
```

If market cap rates are 4.5%, you've created value — the property is worth more than you put into it.
