## Offering Memorandum (OM)

The marketing document prepared by the seller's broker to present the property to potential buyers. OMs range from 20 to 80+ pages and include the property overview, financials, unit mix, market analysis, photos, comparable sales, and the asking price. Think of it as the property's resume — comprehensive but presented in the best possible light.

**What Milo extracts from it:**

- Property details (address, year built, unit count, square footage)
- Asking price and seller's stated cap rate
- Unit mix and floor plan breakdown
- Market and submarket data
- Historical occupancy and rent data
- Renovation history and property condition notes

<Note>
OMs present the seller's best-case numbers. Milo extracts the data but runs its own analysis — so you'll see where the seller's projections differ from what the T12 actually shows.

## Trailing 12-Month Income & Expense Statement (T12)

The actual income and expense report for the last 12 months of operations. Unlike a pro forma (which is a projection), the T12 shows what *actually happened* — what rent was collected, what was spent, and what the property really earned. This is the most important document for underwriting.

**What Milo extracts from it:**

- Gross rental income (collected)
- Other income line items (laundry, parking, fees, RUBS)
- Every expense category (taxes, insurance, utilities, R&M, management, G&A)
- Net operating income
- Month-by-month trends

<Tip>
For best results, upload a full 12-month T12 (not a partial year). Milo can work with shorter periods but a full year gives the most accurate annualized picture.
</Tip>

## Rent Roll

A snapshot of every unit in the property at a specific point in time. The rent roll shows which units are occupied, who the tenant is, what they're paying, what market rent is, and when their lease expires. It's the ground truth for income analysis.

**What Milo extracts from it:**

- Unit numbers, types (1BR, 2BR, etc.), and square footage
- In-place rent vs. market rent (for loss-to-lease analysis)
- Lease start and end dates
- Vacancy status and move-in/move-out dates
- Concessions or special pricing

<Tip>
Upload the most recent rent roll available — ideally within the last 30–60 days. Stale rent rolls can show tenants who have already moved out or rents that have already changed.
</Tip>

## Unit Mix

A summary table showing the breakdown of unit types, counts, sizes, and rents. The unit mix might be embedded in the OM or rent roll, or it may be a standalone document. It gives you the 30,000-foot view of the property's rental composition.

**What Milo extracts from it:**

- Unit type distribution (studio, 1BR, 2BR, 3BR)
- Unit count per type
- Average square footage per type
- Average rent per type (market and in-place)

**Example:**

| Unit Type | Count | Avg SF | Market Rent |
|-----------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1BR/1BA | 12 | 725 | $1,100 |
| 2BR/1BA | 16 | 950 | $1,350 |
| 2BR/2BA | 4 | 1,050 | $1,500 |

## Pro Forma

A forward-looking financial projection — what the seller (or buyer) *expects* the property to earn, usually over 5–10 years. Pro formas include assumptions about rent growth, expense growth, vacancy, and capital improvements. They're useful as a reference but should never be taken at face value.

**What Milo extracts from it:**

- Projected income and expense growth rates
- Seller's assumptions (vacancy, rent increases, capital plans)
- Projected NOI and cash flow by year

<Note>
Milo builds its own projections based on your assumptions and the actual T12 data. If you upload a seller's pro forma, Milo can compare it against its own model so you can see where the seller is being aggressive.
