## Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV)

The percentage of the property's value that the lender will finance. Higher LTV means more leverage (and less equity required), but also more risk and typically a higher interest rate.

**Formula**

```
LTV = Loan Amount / Property Value x 100
```

**How Milo uses it:** LTV is a key financing assumption you set in Milo. It determines the loan amount, which flows into debt service calculations and equity requirements.

**Example:** On a $4,000,000 purchase with 70% LTV:

```
Loan Amount = $4,000,000 x 70% = $2,800,000
Equity Required = $4,000,000 - $2,800,000 = $1,200,000
```

## Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)

The ratio of NOI to annual debt service. DSCR tells the lender (and you) how comfortably the property's income covers its loan payments. Most lenders require a minimum DSCR of 1.20x–1.25x — meaning NOI needs to exceed debt service by at least 20–25%.

**Formula**

```
DSCR = NOI / Annual Debt Service
```

**How Milo uses it:** Milo calculates DSCR for every year of the hold period. If DSCR drops below typical lender thresholds, it's a signal to revisit your assumptions or deal structure.

**Example:**

```
DSCR = $181,978 / $156,000 = 1.17x
```

<Warning>
A DSCR below 1.25x may make it difficult to secure financing. Below 1.0x means the property can't cover its debt payments from operations.
</Warning>

## Debt Yield

NOI divided by the loan amount. Lenders increasingly use debt yield as a sizing metric because it's independent of interest rates and amortization. Think of it as the lender's cap rate on their loan.

**Formula**

```
Debt Yield = NOI / Loan Amount x 100
```

**How Milo uses it:** Milo calculates debt yield in the financing section. Minimum thresholds vary by lender, but 8–10% is a common floor for agency loans.

**Example:**

```
Debt Yield = $181,978 / $2,800,000 = 6.5%
```

---

## Annual Debt Service

The total principal and interest payments on the loan over a 12-month period. This is the fixed obligation that gets subtracted from NOI to arrive at cash flow.

**Formula**

```
Annual Debt Service = Monthly Mortgage Payment x 12
```

**How Milo uses it:** Milo calculates annual debt service based on your financing assumptions (loan amount, interest rate, amortization schedule, IO period) and subtracts it from NOI to project cash flow.

**Example:** A $2,800,000 loan at 6.5% with 30-year amortization:

```
Monthly Payment ≈ $17,700
Annual Debt Service ≈ $212,400
```

---

## Loan Constant

Annual debt service expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. It combines the effects of interest rate and amortization into a single number, making it easy to compare different loan structures.

**Formula**

```
Loan Constant = Annual Debt Service / Loan Amount x 100
```

**How Milo uses it:** Milo displays the loan constant so you can quickly gauge the all-in cost of debt. If the loan constant exceeds the cap rate, leverage is *negative* — meaning debt is dragging down your returns, not boosting them.

**Example:**

```
Loan Constant = $212,400 / $2,800,000 = 7.59%
```

Since the entry cap rate is 4.55%, leverage is negative in this example — the cost of debt exceeds the property yield.

## Interest Rate vs. Mortgage Rate

These are often used interchangeably, but there's a distinction:

- **Interest rate (note rate)** — the rate charged on the loan balance, stated in the loan documents
- **Mortgage rate (effective rate)** — can include the effect of points, fees, and other costs, giving you the true cost of borrowing

**How Milo uses it:** Milo uses the interest rate you input to calculate debt service. When comparing loan quotes, look at the effective rate (including fees) to make apples-to-apples comparisons.

---

## Amortization Period vs. Loan Term

Two different clocks running on the same loan:

- **Amortization period** — the schedule over which the loan *would* be fully paid off (typically 25–30 years). This determines your monthly payment amount.
- **Loan term** — how long the loan actually lasts before it matures and you must refinance or pay it off (typically 5–10 years).

**How Milo uses it:** Milo uses both to model your debt. The amortization period sets the payment amount; the loan term determines the remaining balance at maturity (relevant for refinancing or exit analysis).

**Example:** A 30-year amortization with a 7-year term means your payments are calculated as if you'll pay over 30 years, but the remaining balance is due in full at year 7.

---

## Interest-Only (IO) Period

A period at the beginning of the loan where you only pay interest — no principal paydown. IO periods lower your debt service in the early years, boosting initial cash flow. Common in value-add deals where you need breathing room during renovations.

**Formula**

```
IO Payment = Loan Amount x Interest Rate / 12  (monthly)
```

**How Milo uses it:** If you set an IO period in your financing assumptions, Milo adjusts the debt service schedule accordingly — lower payments during IO, then higher payments once amortization kicks in.

**Example:** $2,800,000 loan at 6.5% interest-only:

```
Monthly IO Payment = $2,800,000 x 6.5% / 12 = $15,167
Annual IO Debt Service = $182,000
```

Compare that to $212,400 with full amortization — IO saves $30,400/year in debt service during the IO period.
