## Net Operating Income (NOI)

The income left over after paying all operating expenses — but *before* debt service, capital expenditures, and income taxes. NOI is the single most important number in commercial real estate. It drives property valuations, determines how much debt you can get, and is the numerator (or denominator) in most return calculations.

**Formula**

```
NOI = Effective Gross Income (EGI) - Total Operating Expenses
```

**How Milo uses it:** NOI is the centerpiece of every Milo analysis. It's calculated from your T12 data and projected forward year-by-year using your rent growth and expense growth assumptions. Every return metric in Milo's output ties back to NOI.

**Example:**

```
  EGI             $441,240
- Total OpEx      $259,262
= NOI             $181,978
```

<Tip>
When comparing properties, NOI is the great equalizer — it strips out financing differences and shows you the property's raw earning power.

## NOI Margin

The percentage of collected revenue that makes it through to NOI. A higher margin means more of every dollar collected drops to the bottom line. It's the inverse view of the expense ratio.

**Formula**

```
NOI Margin = NOI / EGI x 100
```

**How Milo uses it:** Milo displays NOI margin alongside the expense ratio so you can quickly gauge operational efficiency. Comparing NOI margins across properties in your pipeline helps you spot which deals have the tightest operations.

**Example:**

```
NOI Margin = $181,978 / $441,240 = 41.2%
```

For context, a typical stabilized multifamily property runs a 45–60% NOI margin. A 41% margin suggests there may be room to improve operations or push revenue.
