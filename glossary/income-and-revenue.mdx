## Gross Potential Rent (GPR)

The total rental income a property would generate if every unit were leased at full market rent with zero vacancy. This is your theoretical ceiling — the best-case revenue number before any real-world adjustments.

**Formula**

```
GPR = Number of Units x Market Rent per Unit x 12
```

**How Milo uses it:** GPR is the starting point of every income analysis Milo generates. It's pulled from your rent roll and unit mix to establish the top-line revenue figure.

**Example:** A 32-unit property with an average market rent of $1,250/unit:

```
GPR = 32 x $1,250 x 12 = $480,000
```

## Loss to Lease

The difference between what you *could* charge (market rent) and what tenants are *actually* paying (in-place rent). This happens when existing leases were signed at lower rents and haven't rolled to market yet.

**Formula**

```
Loss to Lease = GPR - Total In-Place Rent (annualized)
```

**How Milo uses it:** Milo calculates loss to lease by comparing market rents against in-place rents from your rent roll. A high loss to lease can signal upside — room to push rents at renewal.

**Example:** If GPR is $480,000 but current leases total $456,000 annually:

```
Loss to Lease = $480,000 - $456,000 = $24,000 (5% of GPR)
```

## Vacancy Loss / Vacancy Rate

The income you lose because some units sit empty. Vacancy rate is expressed as a percentage of GPR. Even well-run properties carry some vacancy — there's always turnover.

**Formula**

```
Vacancy Loss = GPR x Vacancy Rate
Vacancy Rate = Vacant Units / Total Units
```

**How Milo uses it:** Milo applies your vacancy assumption (adjustable) to the income model. It also cross-references actual vacancy from your rent roll against your assumption so you can see the gap.

**Example:** At 5% vacancy on $480,000 GPR:

```
Vacancy Loss = $480,000 x 5% = $24,000
```

## Concessions

Discounts or incentives offered to attract or retain tenants — free months of rent, reduced deposits, move-in specials. These reduce your effective collected revenue.

**Formula**

```
Concessions = Total Value of Discounts Given (annualized)
```

**How Milo uses it:** Milo extracts concession data from your T12 and factors it into the income waterfall between GPR and Effective Gross Income.

**Example:** If you offered one month free on 4 units at $1,250/month:

```
Concessions = 4 x $1,250 = $5,000
```

---

## Bad Debt / Credit Loss

Rent that tenants owe but never pay. This is income on paper that you'll never collect — think evictions, skips, and unpaid balances sent to collections.

**Formula**

```
Bad Debt = Billed Rent - Collected Rent (for delinquent accounts)
```

**How Milo uses it:** Milo pulls bad debt from your T12 line items. High bad debt relative to GPR is a red flag Milo highlights in the income breakdown.

**Example:** If $8,000 in rent was billed but never collected over 12 months:

```
Bad Debt = $8,000 (roughly 1.7% of $480,000 GPR)
```

---

## Other Income

Revenue from sources besides rent — laundry facilities, parking fees, pet rent, storage units, RUBS (Ratio Utility Billing System), application fees, late fees, and vending machines.

**How Milo uses it:** Milo extracts other income line items from your T12 and includes them in the total income calculation. Strong other income can meaningfully boost NOI.

**Example:**

| Source | Annual Income |
|--------|-------------|
| Laundry | $6,400 |
| Parking | $9,600 |
| Pet fees | $3,840 |
| Late fees | $2,400 |
| **Total Other Income** | **$22,240** |

## Effective Gross Income (EGI)

The actual revenue you expect to collect after subtracting all the real-world hits from GPR. This is the income number that matters — it's what flows into your expense analysis.

**Formula**

```
EGI = GPR - Vacancy Loss - Loss to Lease - Concessions - Bad Debt + Other Income
```

**How Milo uses it:** EGI is the revenue line that feeds into Milo's NOI calculation. Every expense ratio and return metric references EGI as the top-line number.

**Example:**

```
  GPR                   $480,000
- Vacancy Loss          ($24,000)
- Loss to Lease         ($24,000)
- Concessions            ($5,000)
- Bad Debt               ($8,000)
+ Other Income           $22,240
= EGI                  $441,240
```
